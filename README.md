# Summer Internship Corpus

I created this list of internships for myself and thought that others might be able to benefit from it as well.
The internships.md file is the list of summer internships. Most of the links take you directly to the application page. The check boxed are used to indcate which internships that one has submitted applications to.

You can just use the links provided or you could fork the repo, remove my checkmarks, and start adding your oww. Please let me know of anyother internships that you'd like to add to the list. Either fork the repo add a internship and submit a pull request or just contact me and I'll add it.
